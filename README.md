This is the N2N client for the MacOS. It is already running on my Macbook (Mac OS 10.15 Catalina), and I hope to help those in need.

Before you use this client, you need to install some libraries.

1. Install brew
	Run the following command in the terminal to install the brew:
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

2. Install openssl
	brew install openssl

3. Install tuntap
	brew cask install tuntap

Attention:
	When you are installing tuntap package, you need to allow tuntap package on "privacy security". If tuntap is blocked from installation during the first installation, you will need to allow his permission and install it again on the terminal.

	Good luck!!!
